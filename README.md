Skipify
=======
Skipify is a open source spotify advertisement skipper extension for firefox and chrome (created for [the spotify web client](http://play.spotify.com/), not the desktop app)
Rather than most spotify ad 'muters', Skipify just disables ads entirely.  
You will forget they were ever there.  

##Looking for a desktop version?  
Try the much older [Mutify](http://github.com/jariz/Mutify)

##License
Licensed under the WTFPL (Do What the Fuck You Want to) license http://www.wtfpl.net/  

##Download
- [Chrome](https://github.com/jariz/Skipify/raw/master/skipify.crx)   
- [Firefox](https://github.com/jariz/Skipify/raw/master/skipify.xpi)  

##Installation  
Go to chrome/firefox's addons/extension page and drag and drop the according file onto the page.  
  
##Background  
When Spotify was still native, it was quite hard to circumvent the annoying commercials and developers didn't make it past a commercial muter, which left people with an akward 30 second silence between their songs.  
Now, with the webclient it was my intention to also make a muter, until I realised how simple it was to disable the ads all together!  
  
##Features  

- Disables ads, you won't even notice they were ever there (probably the most important feature)  
- On/Off switch  
- Enables the - otherwise - hidden spotify debug console, Ctrl+Shift+J to see it  
- Notification upon initialization
